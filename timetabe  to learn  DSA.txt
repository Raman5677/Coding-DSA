In between revision is must abt previous done topics
1. Recursion & STL for competitive coding as it help to write efficient code
			 all topics good graps	()1week basic undersatnding is must
2. time and space complexity  
3. pointers and two pointers good graps
4. oops good graps (optional in starting)
	otherwise 
4.1  vectors and all sorting algo with deep understanding. especially merger sorting , bubble sorting 
   and quicksort as most important. 


	hacker is must for any topics as discussed by the code  skool after ever topics
 
5. arrays 2-d matrix                    given a month to practice and get good till and fo revision everyday. 
					After that start with ongoing love babbar sheet of 450 question
	(dp basic algorithm is must for clear understanding of the algorithm.)
6. linked list
7. 2-d linked list 
8. heaps 
9. stacks and queues
10. binary tree 
11. binary search tree 
12. heap trees
13. trie
so on
		write here about the algo u learn and want to learn
1. one pass approach.

		write here that u were ablr to solve but later u would dig deep in it 
1. union-of-two-arrays3538-- from set --- from hash --- solved using brute force
